# Expo Camera Permission Error: Handling Camera Access and Permissions

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: permission-related issues and incorrect camera access.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

**Problem:** The original code attempts to access the camera before permissions are granted or in an unsupported context. This leads to an error preventing the camera from functioning correctly. 

**Solution:** The corrected code ensures that camera permissions are requested and granted before the camera is accessed. It also handles potential errors during the permission request process.
