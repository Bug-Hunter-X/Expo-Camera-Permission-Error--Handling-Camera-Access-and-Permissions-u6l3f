This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API and involves issues with permissions or the way the camera is being accessed.  One common cause is requesting camera permissions at the wrong time or in an incorrect manner. The code might try to access the camera before the permissions are granted, leading to this error.  Another possibility is that the camera is being used in a context where it's not supported, such as during the initial app loading before the necessary components have mounted.
